## ðŸ’¡ Important Notes

### Fee Handling:
- All transaction fees are properly tracked in the `FeeAmount` and `FeeCurrency` columns
- Fees are shown as absolute values (no negative signs)
- TokenTax uses these fees for accurate cost basis calculations

### Date/Time Format:
- Dates use MM/DD/YY format (e.g., 6/3/25)
- Times are in 24-hour format HH:MM (e.g., 13:03)
- Month and day don't have leading zeros (e.g., 6/3 not 06/03)
- Original timezone information preserved in transaction times

### Trade Direction:
- **Buys:** BTC in BuyAmount, USD in SellAmount
- **Sells:** USD in BuyAmount, BTC in SellAmount
- This follows standard accounting: what you GET vs what you GIVE

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### If TokenTax rejects the file:
1. Check that you're uploading the CSV (not opening it)
2. Don't modify the file in Excel (it may change formatting)
3. Verify the first row contains exact column headers

### If transaction counts don't match:
- Remember: Only **crypto-related** transactions are included
- USD deposits are excluded (not taxable)
- Stock trades are excluded (different tax treatment)
- Failed transactions are excluded

### If you need to add more data:
- Keep this converted file as your base
- Run the converter again with new CashApp exports
- Combine the files (being careful not to duplicate transactions)
